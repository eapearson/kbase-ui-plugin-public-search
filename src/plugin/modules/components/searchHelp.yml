      This is JGI Search, a tool which allows you to search through public JGI archived data and import
      it into a KBase Narrative.
      
      To get started, simply type your search terms into the search box and press the search button or press the Return/Enter key.

      You may simply enter all search terms with which you wish to limit the search.
      
      Searches are case insensitive.

      This is a free-text search, so terms will match any available field. Searching by a specific genus, for instance, will match not just the genus field, but may match a title, description, scientific name, or file name.

      The search query supports some basic extended search syntax as described below:
     
        - ```-``` in front of a term negates it
        - ```*``` at the end of a term signifies a prefix query (wildcard)
      
      In order to search for any of these special characters, they will need to be escaped with \\.

      For example:

      To search for "Streptococcus" files for PI "Klenk", simply enter ```streptococcus klenk```. To find files which are NOT associated with Klenk, you could enter ```streptococcus -klenk```. 

      To match all words beginning with strep you may use with ```strep*```.
