      This is KBase Public Search, a tool which allows you to search through public KBase Data, including data included in published Narratives and reference data workspaces.
      
      To get started, simply type your search terms into the search box and press the search button or press the Return/Enter key.

      To search, you simply enter all terms with which you wish to limit the search.
      
      Searches are case insensitive.

      This is a free-text search, so terms will match any available field. Searching by a specific genus, for instance, will match not just the genus field, but may match a title, description, scientific name, or file name.

      You may restrict the search to *Narratives*, *Public Reference Data* or both. 
      
      You may also restrict the search to just one or more *data types*. By default all data types are included.
